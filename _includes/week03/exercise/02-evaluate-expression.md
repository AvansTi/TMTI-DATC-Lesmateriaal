>> ### Exercise 3-2 Evaluate expression
>>
>> Modify the `Expression.cpp` in Github examples in week 3 (Expression). Make the following changes;
>> * Add the operator **^** for exponent
>> * Add the operator **%** for modulus.
>>
>> For example, **3 ^ 2** is **9** and **3 % 1** is 1. The **^** operator has the highest precedence and the **%** operator has the same precedence as the ** * ** and **/** operators. Here is a sample run of the program: 
>> 
>> ```output
>>Enter an expression: ~~(5 * 2 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 % 2) * 4~~
>> (5 * 2 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 % 2) * 4 = 160
>>```
