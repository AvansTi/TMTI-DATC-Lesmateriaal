>> ### Exercise 1-4 Matrix sum
>>
>> Write a method that returns the sum of all the elements in a specific column in a matrix using the following header:
>>
>> ```cpp
>> const int SIZE = 4;
>> double sumColumn(const double m[][SIZE], int rowSize, int columnIndex);
>> ```
>>
>> Write a test program that reads a 3-by-4 matrix and displays the sum of each column. Here is a sample run:
>>
>>```output
>> Enter a 3-by-4 matrix row by row:
>> ~~1.5 2 3 4~~
>> ~~5.5 6 7 8~~
>> ~~9.5 1 3 1~~
>> Sum of the elements at column 0 is 16.5
>> Sum of the elements at column 1 is 9
>> Sum of the elements at column 2 is 13
>> Sum of the elements at column 3 is 13
>> ```
